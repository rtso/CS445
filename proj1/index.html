      <h2>Part 1: Hybrid Images</h2>
				<div>
					My first hybrid image result is of me and a terracotta warrior from
					the Pacific Science Center in Seattle. Since there is more texture on
					the terracotta warrior than on me, I chose to use the high-pass filter
					on the terracotta warrior and the low-pass filter on me.

					My second hybrid image is of me and a caricature that was drawn of me.
					Since the photos were cropped from the same picture, I had to increase
					the contrast on my face so that you could more easily see the shape when
					the photo was blurred. I chose a sigma of 1 and a filter size of 20x20.

					I ran a low-pass filter on the photo of me. It removed a lot of the signals

					</div>
					I say this result is a fail because when you zoom out and the image
					becomes really small, it's difficult to see what's going on in the image.
					There's a lot of detail going on in the climbing image and you lose a lot of that
					detail when you use a low-pass filter on the image. One way we can
					fix this is by using the kayaking photo with the low-pass filter and
					the climbing photo with the high-pass filter. Since the climbing photo
          has more texture, when using a high-pass filter, the texture would be
          retained and we would be able to distinguish the photo.

      <h2>Part 2: Image Enhancement</h2>
        <h3>Color Enhancement</h3>
        I took a photo of Mount Rainier, converted it from RGB to HSV space,
        and used gamma transformation with gamma = 0.5 to increase the saturation.
        <div>

          <img src="images/image_enhancement/color_enhancement/rainier_color_enhanced.jpg" />
        </div>
        <h3>Color Shift</h3>
        I took a photo of a deer and converted it from RGB to Lab space.
        For the enhanced image on the right of the original image, I shifted the red-green channel to
        be more red. You can see that the deer's fur is more red. For the enhanced
        image below the original image, I shifted the yellow-blue channel to be
        less yellow. You can see that the grass looks less yellow and the photo
        looks a lot cooler than the original.

      <h3>Colorized hybrid image</h3>
      For the colorized hybrid image, I'm using the climbing and kayaking images
      as before. Keep in mind that the un-colorized hybrid result turned out a failure.
      Here I show the filtered images, and it looks like the filtered
      kayaking photo did not retain a lot of of the color. It works better to use
      color for the low-frequency component of the hybrid image because the color
      helps us see distinguish shapes in the image that we otherwise would not see.
      Keeping the color in the images works better in this case.

      <h3>Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids</h3>
      Here are the image pyramids for the example with the caricature.

      <h3>Contrast Enhancement</h3>
      Here is the third image enhancement task. I chose a photo of my sister rock
      climbing. I used gamma transformation on the image because the pixels on
      the image occupy the full range of intensiy, but I would just like to make
      some of the color stand out more. I used a gamme of 1.5.
